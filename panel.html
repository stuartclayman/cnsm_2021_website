<h1>Distinguished Expert Panel</h1>


<h2 class="cn-blue">Management and Operational Challenges for the Roaring Twenties</h2>

<!-- <h2>16:00 - 17:00 CET on Thursday November 5, 2020 </h2> -->

<p>The networking field continues to evolve rapidly.  Network softwarization is in full swing, enterprise networking services are increasingly moving to the cloud, network automation and gaining operational insights are top-of-mind for network providers, new services demanding of stringent service-level guarantees are emerging, all happening while the number of interconnected entities, the volume of traffic, and the dependence of our society on networking services continue to grow unabatedly.  We are indeed in a Golden Age of Networking.  Of course, for all of this to continue will also require management technology to not only keep pace, but keep raising the bar to enable the seamless operation of all this - to roll out and deploy new services, avoid disruptions, protect against abuse, and improve networking economics.  This raises the question of the implications on the network and service management field and what specific opportunities and challenges are ahead for this decade.  </p>

<p>This panel will explore those challenges as well as the associated opportunities that are expected to arise within this still very young decade of the "Roaring Twenties".  The panel will be structured along five questions, each exploring a distinctive aspect:   </p>

<p><i>Q1:</i> Programmability and programmable networking services and frameworks. What advances can be expected and/or will be needed to bring programmability of networks to the next level?  Are new programming models needed?  How can not only functionality but also line-rate performance be ensured?  What other challenges arise, e.g. with regards to novel attack vectors?</p>

<p><i>Q2:</i> AI and Machine Learning vs demands for encryption and privacy.  Advances in Machine Learning and AI have been key for increased network automation and optimization.  However, the same techniques that enable these advances can also compromise privacy and digital sovereignty of users.  How will this tug-of-war play out, what advances can be reasonably expected to mitigate between these concerns?</p>

<p><i>Q3:</i> New services needs and expectations from the end-users: for novel applications such as convergence of Operations Technology (Industry 4.0) with IT, Tactile Internet, holographic media, tele-robotics, there is surging interest in QoS and service levels that are not only ultra-low but also predictable.  What are the management ramifications?   </p>

<p><i>Q4:</i> Ramification of new technologies and their interplay with management.  Networking technology continues to evolve and efforts for Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G or Future Internet Evolution are being explored.  What new management challenges can be expected; in which ways can these technologies be shaped also by specific needs of management and offer the opportunity to bring about also advances in management? </p>

<p><i>Q5:</i> Multidomain and trust issues.  Many network services may move beyond the realm of a single domain, requiring collaboration between multiple network providers.  Trust boundaries are a major issue here, as (for example) network providers may be hesitant to provide visibility into their network as might be required or to allow others exert control over traffic. This may also become increasingly a hurdle towards advances with regards to Q1-Q4.  What advances will be needed in management technology to help overcome these concerns?  </p>
