Call for Papers
---------------
New waves  of networked  applications continue to  push the  limits of
what is possible with networks today. For example, Industrial Internet
applications,  Augmented Reality,  Tactile Internet  require ultra-low
latency measured in  single-digit milliseconds and do  not tolerate no
jitter at all. Economic  pressures mandate increasingly cloudification
of real-time applications with precision  service level needs. Many of
those applications are mission-critical and  cannot afford any loss in
connectivity or even single  packets. Collectively, these applications
require   networking   services   that  support   high-precision   and
predictable service  levels with associated guarantees  that border on
determinism.  This requires  a rethinking  of many  of the  principles
underlying existing "Best Effort" internetworking technology.

Various  approaches  are emerging  to  tackle  those challenges.  Data
centers with  fixed topologies and  a constant number of  hops rapidly
replace    conventional   routing    and    more   general    Internet
topologies.  Networks  are  becoming  more programmable  to  allow  to
custom-tailor  and optimize  treatment of  packets and  flows. Related
technologies range  from Service Function Chaining  to Network Slicing
to  SDN.  While  5G is  making URLLC  at the  network edge  a reality,
momentum for  Beyond 5G and 6G  is building to push  the boundaries of
precision  services  beyond  the  edge   and  across  the  core.   One
overarching question concerns how  these technologies can be harnessed
and what additional approaches are needed to deliver on high-precision
and predictable networking. This will involve advances over all planes
of  network  architectures,  such  as programming  and  processing  of
packets in  the data plane,  control interfaces and  ultra-low latency
control  loops  to  optimize  service  levels  in  the  control-plane,
high-precision measurements and telemetry  with nanosecond accuracy at
scale, and related platforms and algorithms in the management plane.

The workshop  aims to  provide a forum  for researchers,  students and
professionals  from  industry  and  academia  to  discuss  challenges,
solution  approaches, and  work-in-progress  to  deliver, manage,  and
control high-precision and  predictable networking services, including
(Ultra) Low-Latency  networks, deterministic networking, 6G,  etc. The
workshop welcomes  papers related  to disruptive  concepts, innovative
solutions, testbeds, experiments, etc.  Topics of Interest include but
are not limited to the following:

- Platforms  to   manage  and  operate  high-precision   networks  and
  services,  e.g.  Industrial  Networks, Tactile  Networks,  Augmented
  Reality (AR), cloud gaming

Submission of Papers

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers that are not
already under  review elsewhere.  Submissions  will be subjected  to a
peer-review  process.  Regular  papers  should be  submitted  in  IEEE
2-column format, with paper length up to 7 pages including references.

Papers have to  be submitted electronically in PDF  format through the
EDAS  conference  management  system available here:

https://edas.info/28754

Authors  of  selected  workshop  papers   will  be  fast  tracked  for
publication in a special issue of  the Springer Journal of Network and
System Management (JNSM) on High  Precision Networking guest edited by
the workshop organizers.
