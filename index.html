      <h2>Message From The Chairs</h2>

We are thus excited to continue CNSM’s tradition of an engaging program that starts with one timely workshop and four mini conference sessions on the first day, followed by three days of a single track consisting of keynotes, technical paper sessions, poster and demo sessions, and a panel of distinguished experts. Our last day of the conference ends with one workshop and two tutorials.  Details are as follows:</p>

      <p>CNSM 2021 was originally planned to be held in Izmir, Turkey. Meanwhile, despite our strong desire and continued efforts to have an "<i>in-person</i>" event, the organizing committee of the CNSM 2021 has decided to run the conference as a virtual event, allowing only remote participation, due to the uncertainty of the current pandemic situation all around the world that prevented many of us from traveling. Our main goal has been to think safety first, avoiding any risk of being quarantined. </p>
      
      <p>CNSM 2021 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society and IFIP, as well as ACM’s in-Cooperation support. It mainly owes its success to a dedicated community of researchers from academia and industry on network and service management that has formed over the years. Consequently, we are first grateful to the many authors who submitted timely papers. Second, we are indebted the numerous reviewers who analyzed more than 170 conference, demo and workshop papers, so that only proposals that meet the highest standards have been selected for presentation at CNSM 2021 and the co-located workshops. Needless to say, we duly acknowledge the hard work and tireless efforts of the many volunteers in the Organizing and Technical Program committees that allowed us offering such a comprehensive program. Finally, we would like to express our gratitude to our patrons: FutureWei Technologies, Andasis, and ARGELA, and partners: Ulakbim, Ege University and University College of London, for their support and generosity.</p>

      <p>Special thanks go to Aziza Lounis and DNAC team for managing the CNSM 2021 online platforms. </p>

      <p>The 17th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM) is inviting authors to submit original contributions in network and service management research. CNSM 2021 is a selective single- track conference, covering all aspects of the management of networks and services, pervasive systems, enterprises, and cloud computing environments. The core track will be accompanied by a series of
        workshops and poster sessions.</p>

      <p class="cn-blue">
        Despite the passionate desire to have an "in-person" event, due to the uncertainty of the current pandemic situation all around the world,  the organizing committee of the CNSM 2021 has decided to run the conference as an <em>virtual event, allowing only remote participation</em>.  Our main goal has been to think safety first while preparing an excellent technical program: quality also matters!  
      </p>

       <p class="cn-blue">
      We encourage everyone to physically participate as much as can in this event to be held in the beautiful city of Izmir, Turkey. Meanwhile, we also understand if you cannot make the trip to attend in person.  Therefore, we are preparing the infrastructure for remote participation. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="cn-blue">
        We are preparing the infrastructure for remote participation, however we will be asking all presenters to deliver their talk in live mode while pre-recorded video will be available for post-event streaming.
      </p>


      <p class="cn-blue">
        Keeping this hybrid mode in mind, we also made significant restructuring of the registration fees. In particular, we have decided to separate the Welcome Reception and the Gala Dinner to keep the registration fees low. Please check next when Registration opens.
      </p>

      <p class="cn-blue">
        We are looking forward to meeting you virtually at CNSM 2021.
