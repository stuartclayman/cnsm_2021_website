      <h1 class="cn-no-top-margin">Welcome to CNSM 2021</h1>

      <p>The 17th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM) is inviting authors to submit original contributions in network and service management research. CNSM 2021 is a selective single- track conference, covering all aspects of the management of networks and services, pervasive systems, enterprises, and cloud computing environments. The core track will be accompanied by a series of
        workshops and poster sessions.</p>

      <p class="cn-blue">
        Despite the passionate desire to have an "in-person" event, due to the uncertainty of the current pandemic situation all around the world,  the organizing committee of the CNSM 2021 has decided to run the conference as an <em>virtual event, allowing only remote participation</em>.  Our main goal has been to think safety first while preparing an excellent technical program: quality also matters!
      </p>

      <p class="cn-blue">
      We encourage everyone to physically participate as much as can in this event to be held in the beautiful city of Izmir, Turkey. Meanwhile, we also understand if you cannot make the trip to attend in person.  Therefore, we are preparing the infrastructure for remote participation. 
      </p>
      <p class="cn-blue">
      We will be asking all presenters, either on site or remote, to deliver their talk in live mode while pre-recorded video will be available for post-event streaming.
      </p>

      <p class="cn-blue">
      Keeping this hybrid mode in mind, we also made significant restructuring of the registration fees. In particular, we have decided to separate the Welcome Reception and the Gala Dinner to keep the registration fees low. Please check next when Registration opens.
      </p>

      <p class="cn-blue">
      We are looking forward to meeting you at CNSM 2021, either in person or virtually.
      </p>
