<p><span class="cnsm-theme">1st Joint International Workshop on Network Programmability & Automation (NetPA 2021)</span>
  <br/>
  <span class="cn-blue">Monday 25 October 2021</span></p>

<p>With the same spirit of CNSM as a whole, the workshop on “Network Programmability and Automation” (NetPA) aims at providing an international forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry at large, including network operators, service providers, equipment manufacturers and IT companies, to discuss and address the challenges deriving from network programmability and network zero-touch automation for the delivery and operation of networks and services. On the one hand, the workshop will discuss the use of analytics and AI-based models to perform decision making at abstracted levels of the network to bring flexible and adaptive network service provisioning while ensuring smooth service continuity, SLA-compliance and service assurance. On the other hand, the workshop captures the evolutions of networking protocols towards more performance and security. This includes the design of high-level languages and associated tool chains for specifying network and nodes behaviors, automated methods and tools for validating both control and data plane operation; protocols for network programmability like Segment Routing; programmable data plane architectures, hardware platforms, software execution environments; network applications addressing open problems in traffic engineering, measurement, and problem diagnosis.</p>


<p> The NetPA workshop will be held on Monday October 25th. The program can be found <a href="http://www.cnsm-conf.org/2021/program.html">here</a>.</p>

     </p>


     <p>
     <strong>Paper Submissions:</strong><br/>
     Authors are invited to submit original unpublished papers not under review elsewhere. Submissions will be subjected to a peer-review process. Regular papers should be submitted in IEEE 2-column format, with paper length up to 7 pages including references. The workshop aims at stimulating an open discussion, therefore papers describing innovative but still preliminary ideas or position papers will be evaluated for their merit by the TPC.

     Authors should register and upload paper submissions <a href="https://edas.info/28753">https://edas.info/28753</a>

     <h3>Workshop Description</h3>

     <p>
     Historically, networks were operated by exploiting specialized high performance hardware components performing specific tasks, such as address translation, tunneling, load balancing, traffic engineering, protocol accelerators, performance improvement proxies, traffic monitoring, filtering and protection, intrusion detection, etc. Clearly this approach was meant to cope with the ever increasing performance requirements we witnessed in the last years, but on the other hand it was not well suited to address the highly dynamic networking scenarios in which new protocols, new applications and new technologies are constantly added to the picture. 
     </p>

     <p>Novel approaches like SDN and NFV revoluzioned the network function design and implementation by providing the enabling tools for the deployment of programmable and scalable networks. After years of research many application scenarios were proved to benefit from this innovative paradigm shift to the point that programmable network building blocks are widely acknowledged as the foundation of modern networks.
     </p>

     <p>Nevertheless, many aspects are still under investigation. We believe that several questions are still open, like : “what is the best high level language?”, “what are the most suited HW/SW architectures?”, “how can we exploit HW offloading opportunities?”, “can we further optimize/accelerate the network workloads?”, "how can we program network-wide services by chaining local network functions in a scalable way?", "what is the interaction between programmability at node level and programmability at network level?"
