<span class="cnsm-theme">1st International Workshop on Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZNSM 2021)</span>

<p>With the same spirit of CNSM as a whole, this workshop on “Zero-touch Network and Service Management” (ZNSM) aims at providing an international forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and the industry at large, including network operators, service providers, equipment manufacturers and IT companies, to discuss and address the challenges deriving from automation in the delivery and operation of networks and services through the use of analytics and AI-based models to perform decision making at all levels of operations: optimize resource sharing, reduce resource capability consumption using flexible and adaptive network service provisioning, and support new deployment models while ensuring smooth service continuity, SLA-compliance and end-to-end automation of the management and orchestration of network services and resources.
