<h2>ZNSM</h2>

<span class="cnsm-theme">1st International Workshop on Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZNSM 2021)</span>

<p>With the same spirit of CNSM as a whole, this workshop on “Zero-touch Network and Service Management” (ZNSM) aims at providing an international forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and the industry at large, including network operators, service providers, equipment manufacturers and IT companies, to discuss and address the challenges deriving from automation in the delivery and operation of networks and services through the use of analytics and AI-based models to perform decision making at all levels of operations: optimize resource sharing, reduce resource capability consumption using flexible and adaptive network service provisioning, and support new deployment models while ensuring smooth service continuity, SLA-compliance and end-to-end automation of the management and orchestration of network services and resources.

<h3>Workshop Description</h3>


<p>
  As we are heading towards nascent 6G networks, this is the appropriate time to do a hindsight exercise to gather the lessons learned to start shaping the networks to come in a coherent and converged manner towards a service-oriented automatically managed network. The adoption of virtualization and softwarization for networks and ICT infrastructures in general is more than ever an opportunity of moving network solutions to customized end-to-end, yet private and independent, network services designed and delivered on-demand over heterogeneous network segments and infrastructures. The ever-growing connectivity demand and continually more stringent performance requirements along with operational and environmental costs are pushing the boundaries of network solutions to maximize the efficiency of every deployment and operation action.
</p>

<p>
  In this direction, automation and its extreme form known as “zero-touch” has drawn the attention of many actors from the IT, Telecom and Cloud sectors. A plethora of initiatives dealing with all related aspects from a global or specialized point of view for 5G and beyond networks can be cited here: TMF ZOOM, ETSI ZSM, ETSI ENI, RAN-related management initiatives (O-RAN, ONF SD-RAN), different EU and non-EU research projects like MON-B5G, 5G-DIVE, 5Growth, 5GZORRO, INSPIRE5Gplus, and last but not least the Hexa-X project recently launched as a flagship 6G European initiative.
</p>

<p>
  An important objective of zero-touch is to go beyond the use of software-based solutions to automate some well-understood tasks for the sake of time savings. Zero-touch considers to make full use of analytics and AI-based models to perform decision making at all levels of operations: optimize resource sharing, reduce consumption using flexible mechanisms for network service provisioning, and support new deployment models adapted to massively distributed infrastructures, while ensuring smooth service continuity, SLA-compliance and end-to-end automation of the management and orchestration of network services and resources. Automation brings a series of challenges to the ways in which network services and more generally network slices are designed, deployed, provided and intelligently managed. Multiple issues are still to be addressed for zero-touch to be concretely adopted by the Industry. One important direction is the need to converge on the way societal stimuli coming in the form of service requests from a variety of vertical industries (e.g., industry 4.0, transportation, energy, automotive, eHealth) are handled by the network. And it is not only about dynamically deploying the service, but most importantly about continuously monitoring it and providing the various control loops towards 24/7 operation whilst fulfilling SLA requirements. This is the point at which the network will become a catalyzer of all sorts of economic activity of our society, at the level of what the Internet represented half a century ago.
