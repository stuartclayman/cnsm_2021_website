<h3>Workshop Description</h3>

<p>
New waves of networked applications continue to push the limits of what is possible with networks today. For example, Industrial Internet applications, Augmented Reality, Tactile Internet require ultra-low latency measured in single-digit milliseconds and do not tolerate no jitter at all. Economic pressures mandate increasingly cloudification of real-time applications with precision service level needs. Many of those applications are mission-critical and cannot afford any loss in connectivity or even single packets. Collectively, these applications require networking services that support high-precision and predictable service levels with associated guarantees that border on determinism. This requires a rethinking of many of the principles underlying existing "Best Effort" internetworking technology.
</p>

<p>
Various approaches are emerging that try to tackle those challenges. Data centers with fixed topologies and a constant number of hops rapidly replace conventional routing and more general Internet topologies. Networks are becoming more programmable to allow to custom-tailor and optimize treatment of packets and flows. Related technologies range from Service Function Chaining to Network Slicing to SDN. While 5G is making URLLC at the network edge a reality, momentum for Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G is building to push the boundaries of precision services beyond the edge and across the core. One overarching question concerns how these technologies can be harnessed and what additional approaches are needed to be able to actually deliver on high-precision and predictable networking. This will involve advances over all the planes constituting a network architecture, such as programming and processing of packets in the data plane, control interfaces and ultra-low latency control loops to optimize service levels in the control-plane and finally high-precision measurements and telemetry with nanosecond accuracy at scale as well as advances in the related platforms and algorithms in the management plane.
