<h3>Workshop Description</h3>

<p>
New waves of networked applications continue to push the limits of what is possible with networks today. For example, Industrial Internet applications, Augmented Reality, Tactile Internet require ultra-low latency measured in single-digit milliseconds and do not tolerate no jitter at all. Economic pressures mandate increasingly cloudification of real-time applications with precision service level needs. Many of those applications are mission-critical and cannot afford any loss in connectivity or even single packets. Collectively, these applications require networking services that support high-precision and predictable service levels with associated guarantees that border on determinism. This requires a rethinking of many of the principles underlying existing "Best Effort" internetworking technology.
</p>

<p>
Various approaches are emerging that try to tackle those challenges. Data centers with fixed topologies and a constant number of hops rapidly replace conventional routing and more general Internet topologies. Networks are becoming more programmable to allow to custom-tailor and optimize treatment of packets and flows. Related technologies range from Service Function Chaining to Network Slicing to SDN. While 5G is making URLLC at the network edge a reality, momentum for Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G is building to push the boundaries of precision services beyond the edge and across the core. One overarching question concerns how these technologies can be harnessed and what additional approaches are needed to be able to actually deliver on high-precision and predictable networking. This will involve advances over all the planes constituting a network architecture, such as programming and processing of packets in the data plane, control interfaces and ultra-low latency control loops to optimize service levels in the control-plane and finally high-precision measurements and telemetry with nanosecond accuracy at scale as well as advances in the related platforms and algorithms in the management plane. 
</p>

<p>
  The workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers, students and professionals from industry and academia to discuss challenges, solution approaches, and work-in-progress to deliver, manage, and control high-precision and predictable networking services, including (Ultra) Low-Latency networks, deterministic networking, 6G, etc. The workshop welcomes papers related to disruptive concepts, innovative solutions, testbeds, experiments, etc. Topics of Interest include but are not limited to the following:

<h3>Keynote</h3>

<p>Experienced Deep Learning and Control for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications by <i>Walid Saad (Virginia Tech, USA)</i></p>

<p>In this talk, we provide an overview on the frontier of research in the area of ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). In particular, we first introduce a novel framework that combines deep reinforcement learning with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enable model-free URLLC under limited data availability and without requiring any knowledge or assumptions on the delay models of the wireless users. We show how the proposed experienced deep reinforcement learning framework can intelligently optimize wireless resources while balancing the tradeoff between reliability, latency, and rate. This approach presents a major departure from prior URLLC approaches that often ignore the rate constraints of the users and rely on historic data or on unrealistic delay modeling assumptions. Then, we turn our attention to the problem of joint communications and control for autonomous connected vehicles. In this area, we introduce a new model for characterizing the wireless reliability of an autonomous vehicle system while being explicitly cognizant of its control system requirements. After characterizing reliability, we show how one can optimize the operation of the autonomous vehicle system while jointly taking into account the delay of the vehicular network and the stability of the control system The synergies between URLLC and control system designs are then discussed. We conclude the talk with an overview on future opportunities in these exciting areas.</p>

<p>Abstract:<br/>
New networked applications, such as cyber-physical systems, augmented/virtual reality or industrial applications require high-precision, predictable and low-latency networking. After previous editions of the HiPNet workshop discussed the readiness of the Internet for high precision networking (HiPNet 2018) and the applicability of service function chaining for providing high precision networking (HiPNet 2019), this panel will focus on the implementation of high precision networking.
The panel will discuss what are the key differences towards “normal” networking, which make the implementation of high precision networking fundamentally different from established networking concepts. Moreover, it will be debated which functionalities are required for monitoring, measuring, and managing networks, and where they need to be implemented, e.g., at the network core or at the edge. Finally, the question arises what impact virtualization has on service assurance and fulfillment, and which technologies, such as programmable data planes, network slicing, or AI/ML-supported network management, are most promising towards implementing high precision networking. Thereby, the panel aims to identify open research questions, which need to be tackled in the future.</p>
