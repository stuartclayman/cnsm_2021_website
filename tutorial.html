<h2 class="cn-blue">AI-ML-DL for Embedding Intelligence in Future Network</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Tapalina Bhattasali PhD, Kolkata, India.</h3>


 
<p>Network Intelligence considers the embedding of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) in future networks to fasten service delivery and operations, guarantee service availability, allow better agility, resiliency, faster customization, and security. These features perfectly match the complex, dynamic and time-varying nature of future networks. Network intelligence can provide real-time awareness of how a network is performing, with alerts and a clear data trail if a cyber-security issue occurs. This tutorial explores the impact of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning logic to incorporate intelligence in future networks.</p>

<p>Network Intelligence tutorial encompasses three main parts. In the first part, the background on Network Intelligence will be presented i.e., the latest state of the art on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL) for network and service management. In the second part, focus will be on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques for network data analysis to find optimal solution. Various techniques like prediction, classification, clustering, etc will be discussed for case-specific scenarios. In the third part, real-life case studies like forecasting of network data, anomaly detection, etc. will be demonstrated using AI-ML-DL techniques. The demonstration will make use of real network data.</p>

<p>Previsions for 2025 estimate nearly 64 billion Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices connected via the Internet to diverse application scenarios. These scenarios show particularities in terms of devices, communications, data, and services, which increase the complexity of achieving one of their common challenges: to optimize the efficiency of their services. Today, a thriving challenge in behavior data science lies in creating behavior patterns (fingerprints) of devices and networks to optimize their performance and detect potential concerns, especially cyberthreats at early stages. </p>

<p>This tutorial provides an overview of tools and techniques toward behavioral fingerprinting and how these can be used to optimize the efficiency of heterogeneous application scenarios such as cybersecurity, or device authentication. Also, this tutorial explains well-known techniques used to create and evaluate fingerprints, paying particular attention to recent and promising Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches. Further, this is discussed in detail within a set of real use cases, where behavioral fingerprinting is applicable to solve cybersecurity concerns of IoT-based application scenarios. Finally, a selected set of lessons learned within this dedicated area of security management is presented and future trends of behavioral fingerprinting are outlined. </p>
