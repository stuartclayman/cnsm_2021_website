<h2>NetP</h2>

<span class="cnsm-theme">1st Network Programmability workshop </span>

<p>The NetP workshop aims at openly discussing new trends and open issues in network programmability, both at node-level and at network-level. This includes the design of high-level languages and associated tool chains for specifying network and nodes behaviors, automated methods and tools for validating both control and data plane operation; protocols for network programmability like Segment Routing; programmable data plane architectures, hardware platforms, software execution environments; network applications addressing open problems in traffic engineering, measurement, and problem diagnosis.

<h3>Workshop Description</h3>

<p>
  Historically, networks were operated by exploiting specialized high performance hardware components performing specific tasks, such as address translation, tunneling, load balancing, traffic engineering, protocol accelerators, performance improvement proxies, traffic monitoring, filtering and protection, intrusion detection, etc. Clearly this approach was meant to cope with the ever increasing performance requirements we witnessed in the last years, but on the other hand it was not well suited to address the highly dynamic networking scenarios in which new protocols, new applications and new technologies are constantly added to the picture. 
</p>

<p>Novel approaches like SDN and NFV revoluzioned the network function design and implementation by providing the enabling tools for the deployment of programmable and scalable networks. After years of research many application scenarios were proved to benefit from this innovative paradigm shift to the point that programmable network building blocks are widely acknowledged as the foundation of modern networks.
</p>

<p>Nevertheless, many aspects are still under investigation. We believe that several questions are still open, like : “what is the best high level language?”, “what are the most suited HW/SW architectures?”, “how can we exploit HW offloading opportunities?”, “can we further optimize/accelerate the network workloads?”, "how can we program network-wide services by chaining local network functions in a scalable way?", "what is the interaction between programmability at node level and programmability at network level?"
