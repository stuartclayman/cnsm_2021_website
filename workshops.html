      <h2>NetP</h2>

      <span class="cnsm-theme">1st International Workshop on Network Programmability (NetP 2021)</span>

      <p>The NetP workshop aims at openly discussing new trends and open issues in network programmability, both at node-level and at network-level. This includes the design of high-level languages and associated tool chains for specifying network and nodes behaviors, automated methods and tools for validating both control and data plane operation; protocols for network programmability like Segment Routing; programmable data plane architectures, hardware platforms, software execution environments; network applications addressing open problems in traffic engineering, measurement, and problem diagnosis.
