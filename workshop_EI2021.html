<h3>Workshop Description</h3>

<p>
  Edge Intelligence considers the combined use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Multi-Access Edge Computing paradigm in future networks to address the requirements of both final users and network operators. About the first ones, it will guarantee the final application’s requirements in terms of latency, delay, reliability and robustness, security and costs. On the other hand, telco providers will be able to manage network facilities in a more efficient way, implementing also zero- touch management solutions capable of self-adapting to different network conditions.</p>

<p>
  The main goal of the Edge Intelligence Workshop is to present state-of-the-art research results and experience reports about the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques applied at the Edge of 5G&B and the 6G future networks, focusing on models for network and service management of the resources located in the edge nodes. The variety of new services and applications with heterogeneous characteristics in terms of generated traffic, mobility, Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements, and the consequent increment of data transmitted on the next communication networks, demonstrate the importance of providing AI solutions to manage in an efficient way the resources at the Edge.
