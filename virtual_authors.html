      <h1>Authors Guidelines</h1>
      

      <p>As CNSM 2021 will be held as a virtual conference, speakers may be able to record and submit a video of their talk by <span style="color: #ee6611;"><b>18 October 2021<b></span>. On that day speakers will receive an email, from Whova, containing an online form to submit your video, fill in your bio and complete your profile.</p>

      <p>During the conference on  <span class="cn-blue">25 – 29 October 2021</span>, each Presenter is requested to join his/her session in order to <em>give their presentation live</em> and to be online to answer questions from the audience. Otherwise, the paper might not be published in IEEE Xplore.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Important for Demo Sessions</em>
        Presentation of demos are also to be made live and should highlight how the demo is running. Yet it is not requested that the demo itself is played live. To that aim, the presentation should include video captions to highlight the various steps in the demo.</p>

      <p>
        It is highly recommended to join the session <em>5 minutes</em> before the session starts to check that each presenter is on, and in case there is a need of swapping between presentations in the session. Be aware that pre-recorded video of presentation are <em>NOT</em> meant to be played during the Session.</p>

      <p>We strongly recommend speakers to check if they are assigned to their proper paper session in the <a href="program.html">program page</a>, and to notify the organizers if you are not the presenter of the paper or won’t be able to be present on that day.</p>

      <p>If that is the case, you should send an email containing all the information (Full name, email, affiliation, country) about the final presenter who will replace your Whova profile account, please note that you won’t be able to access the conference content anymore. Otherwise the presenter should register for the conference with the participant rate so that both of you can have access.</p>

      <p>Below are the exact duration of videos and Q&A sessions depending on the paper type:</p>

      <p>Duration of video files:</p>

      <h3>Instructions for Video Recording</h3>

      <p>
        Videos should contain a prominent view of the presentation
        slides along with audio of the spoken presentation. Optionally
        videos may contain a shot of the speaker's head for increased
        engagement. (This shot should be thumbnail-sized and overlayed
        on the slide images as shown in this
        Youtube <img src="https://networking.ifip.org/2020/images/youtube.png" width="32">
        video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8JV3w4TOVw">here</a>.)
        Many presentation software allows recording audio and video
        directly in the application and can export appropriate video
        files. Please see the notes below for detailed instructions
        for PowerPoint and KeyNote. If you use a different
        application, please see the notes under <a href="#other">Other Options</a>.
