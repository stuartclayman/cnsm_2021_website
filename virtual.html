      <p class="cn-blue"><em>Please note that the same email address used for the registration should be also used for both Whova and Webex Meetings, or else you wonâ€™t be able to attend the sessions.</em></p>

      <p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the conference will take place virtually, we are doing our best for a smooth conference, for this we will be using two different platforms: <a href="https://www.webex.com/">Cisco Webex Meetings</a> and <a href="https://whova.com/portal/webapp/icnas_202110/">Whova</a>.</p>

      <p>Cisco Webex Meetings will be the main video conferencing software used for paper presentations and all other sessions during the Conference. <br/>
        <em>Accessing the meeting will be through the Whova App only, meetings link/URL won't be shared.</em></p>
