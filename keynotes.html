<h2 class="cn-blue">Softwarizing the Network for Tomorrow</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Burak Gorkemli, Argela, Turkey</h3>

<p>Network softwarization with the usage of SDN & NFV technologies is the paradigm that enables agility, cost effectiveness, vendor independence and heterogeneity requirements of the next generation communication networks. With the pandemic skyrocketing the broadband usage at homes and 5G deployments on its way, operators are looking for ways to increase their fixed broadband coverage in cost effective and future proof ways. Here, network softwarization, together with disaggregation and cloud technologies, may be the yellow brick road that will lead all to success. This talk addresses the open-source efforts world's leading operators have spent to build the SDN enabled broadband access solution, as well as the specification efforts spent in relevant communities. We will see the state-of-the-art in network softwarization, highlighting different trends followed by the industry. Next, we will discuss how these technologies will shape the future of communication.

<h2 class="cn-blue">Virtualization, AI & Zero Touch for more efficient &amp; sustainable network</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Marie-Paule Odini, HPE, France</h3>

<p>With ICT representing 5 to 9% of global electricity consumption, and traffic increase leading to more and more demand for resources, optimizing the network is becoming critical to deliver quality services at a reasonable cost and while reducing carbon impact. Virtualization has proven to be quite effective to bring flexibility but complexity of disaggregated networks and dynamic topologies is becoming a challenge to serve real time service request and very heterogeneous traffic patterns. This presentation will highlight some of the use cases and technologies developed to cope with these challenges, including AI and Machine Learning and the evolution towards GreenG.</p>

<h2 class="cn-blue">From managing networks to programming networks: Moving beyond the ASN.1 era</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Henning Schulzrinne, Columbia University USA</h3>

<p>
  Network management seems to be stuck in the 1990s - enterprise and carrier-grade network devices support SNMP and, less commonly, YANG, but there's essentially no way to create monitoring applications for home or small-enterprise devices from computers to printers to IoT devices and network switches. SNMP itself offers an abstraction that makes programming hard, even if libraries hide the ancient ASN.1 BER encoding that isn't used anywhere else. While YANG is a bit closer to programming models used elsewhere, it does not seem to have been widely adopted. Meanwhile, most network monitoring and configuration seems to rely on traffic analysis using Wireshark and similar tools, along with the traditional command line (CLI) and web interfaces. For cloud services, most programmers are likely to experience network management through cloud-specific proprietary APIs, not network management libraries and protocols. In parallel, the number of engineers trained in networking is dwarfed by those who are cloud-first or mainly care about applications. Data scientists, say, could help many larger organizations better understand their network, but they are unlikely to want to add obscure facets of SNMP or NETCONF/YANG to their skill set. Thus, as networks are becoming a smaller and smaller part of the overall IT ecosystem, we should think about what it would take to modernize notions of network management and make network devices appear like other services. I argue that database models, APIs and event notifications are better foundations for making network services programmable and it's time to abandon the ecological niche model.

<h2 class="cn-blue">Toward the era of modularization</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Markus Gruber, Nokia - Bell Labs, Germany</h3>

<p>The ever-increasing number of degrees of freedom in telecommunication networks imposes severe complexity challenges on management and orchestration. Simplicity, separation of concerns, and open ecosystems have proven to be success principles in the tech industry over the last decades and they are also applicable here. We are approaching a future where intuitive intents drive the creation and removal of ephemeral network and compute slices and where learnings from a given network configuration can be transferred to new settings. The latter is particularly useful for Industrial IoT where reconfigurations are frequent by nature. Particularly in these environments, we can also exploit the cyclic and repetitive nature of industrial processes for a better anticipation of what will happen in the network.</p>

     <h2 class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 1em;">Revitalizing Network and Service Management with Programmable Data Planes: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Luciano Paschoal Gaspary, UFRGS, Brazil</h3>

<p>
In recent years, we have witnessed the emergence of programmable data planes (PDPs). Boosted by reconfigurable Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), forwarding devices can be programmed with custom logic while providing per-packet traffic visibility and sustaining hundreds of Gbps, line-rate operation. The programmable network concept - to a significant extent investigated by the research community for a long time - now shows clear signs of having evolved, matured, and found a fertile ground to develop, experiencing the enthusiasm of both academia and industry. In this talk, we will address the "Renaissance" of programmable networks, focusing on PDPs as a unique tool to revitalize network and service management. We will briefly revisit the progress, lessons learned, and challenges of designing innovative management solutions on PDPs. We will also discuss ongoing work and opportunities of how our community can promote the advancement of the field.
